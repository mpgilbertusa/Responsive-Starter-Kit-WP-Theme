Some additional content will eventually go here. It will be quite epic and generally useful in a variety of ways.

If you're feeling anxious, grab some [WordPress test data](https://wpcom-themes.svn.automattic.com/demo/theme-unit-test-data.xml), import it into your local install and check out the theme in action. Additional information can be found on the WordPress [Theme Unit Test](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test) page.
